What Next App - Project Info
=======================================

Enchancing an existing application written in JavaScript

* * *

### Client Request

Our developer left non functional application and quit the project. We need a JavaScript developer to learn about this
project, fix it and improve it by addressing all the areas marked on the audit.

Tasks to do:

1. Find bugs that prevent the application from functioning.
2. Optimise application and it's code.
3. Add automated tests to make sure application is working correctly.
4. Analyze performance.
5. Write technical documentation.

### Solution

Initially I spend few hours to figure out how the application was written and how it works. I fixed typos and erorrs 
that prevented it from functioning. I wrote tests using `JasmineJS` test suite. I've written missing test cases and performed
dev tools audit. It revealed a list of things needed to be addressed in order to improve applications performance, SEO
ranking and to implement best practices. I've addressed each and every one of them and brought audit results to 90-100%
range. Then I wrote a documentation which describes all key information about the project. It contains information about
MVC structure, file structure and their inner key methods explained, bug fixes I've done to improve it, test cases added
and audit information.
